# Searchbar Task
Welcome to our small example to test your code style and patterns!
Your task is to link the present searchfield in `src/components/SearchField.vue` to the wikipedia api.
The user wants to enter some text and wants to see wikipedia pages matching the string.
You can either directly search on input entered or wait for enter/icon clicked.
Matching results should be presented either as a dropdown below the search or as a modal.

As this is a git repository I ask you to commit your work here.
Once you're done, send us back the whole folder as a .zip and we'll be happy to review it.

Have fun and thank you for your time! I am looking forward to your solution.
